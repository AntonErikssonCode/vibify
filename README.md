# Vibify 
Vibify is a React research project with the goal of visualizing audio in 3D. Several approaches are being investigated such as real time audio extraction your raw audio as well as the implementation of the Spotify API and SDK. 

## Features

- Spotify Authentication, Song Search, Playback and Api feature extraction.
- Demo song and Real Time audio feature extraction using [Meyda](https://meyda.js.org/).
- [Meyda](https://meyda.js.org/) feature extraction on microphone input. 
- Basic manipulatable React 3D-components.

## Installation

Vibify requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to run.

Clone the repository. 

If you want to use the Spotify functionality you need to [Create a Spotify App ](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login) to get access to you client and secret key. Create a .env file in the server folder with the following variables:

```sh
CLIENT_KEY = <"YOUR CLIENT KEY">
SECRET_KEY = <"YOUR SECRET CLIENT KEY">
```

**Install** the Node Modules for the frontend...

```sh
cd client
npm install
```
...and the backend. Note that the backend is only used for Spotify API/SDK authorization. 
```sh
cd server
npm install
```


**Run** the project by starting up the client...
```sh
cd client
npm start
```
...and the server.
```sh
cd server
npm run devStart
```
